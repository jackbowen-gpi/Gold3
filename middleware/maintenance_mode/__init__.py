"""Lightweight shim for the optional `maintenance_mode` package.

Some deployments don't install the 3rd-party `maintenance_mode` package.
Guard the import so that importing this module doesn't raise during project
startup (which would allow top-level URL imports to fail). If the package
is missing, expose a sensible default version string.
